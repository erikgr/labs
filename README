Random lab stuff for testing and figuring shit out.
All of the stuff here is of little use to you and
is for POC or experimental purposes only. It will not
contain proper error handling, input validation, common
sense, uncommon sense, best practices, or any practices
for that matter. You should probably think thrice before
you run anything from here.
